Current Goal:
- do a basic wrapper over the current constructs before adding more features
- find a nice list of keycode mappings so we can stop referring to them by name
- maintain the current functionality but quit after ctrl C, nop for non alpha chars
TODO:
- learn from nano how they do key code assignment
- handle line feeds/carriage returns?
- handle basic movement keys

Fixes:
1) TextWindow feeds too much of the string i.e. [start column, end of string)
  To fix this, you need to truncate it in case the string is too long

Current Goal:
1) Render cursor
2) Control movement
3) Single cursor selection
  * Edit (insert/delete) selection
  * Cancel and quit selection move
4) File opening/saving

Side Goals for Better Design:
- Work on how cursor is implemented for textbuffer
  * Consider making a cursor that has a "ghost" cursor inside the buffer
  * That way we can keep a fake cursor that is what we expect it to be :(row, col)
  * and an actual cursor that indices into our textbuffer
- Work on making a rendering class
  * There should be a rendering struct, or some form of element, that we can make
  * whose responsibility is to render elements of our UI
- Decide on a textbuffer API
  * which things need to be leaked
  * and which things should be abstracted
- Some kind of textbufferview? one for rendering, one for algos

Next milestone (notepad editor):
- render a cursor (motivates building a library)
- search (use kmp or something cool maybe)
- line jumps, page jumps
- cut/paste/multiline highlighting (requires better cursor manipulation)
- add a save menu
- implement opening files
- delete key

TODO:
- Optional Word Wrapping
- Syntax highlighting (for just C++ and idk.. python)
- Formatting on save using like clang-formatter or pep 
- Piece table because thatâ€™s the only real reason
- Multicursor edits
- Some very basic form of word suggest? 
- A basic command palette (not that I know what to put in this yet. Maybe stuff like saving, new panes)
- Not sure if I can but multiple panes? (I feel like this leads into the library project)
- Smaller stuff would be like setting tab stops

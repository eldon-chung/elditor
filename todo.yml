Current Goal:
1) Make TextWindow "chase" the cursor
2) Shift movement
3) Control movement
4) Alt movement
5) Single cursor selection
  * Edit (insert/delete) selection
  * Cancel and quit selection move
6) File opening/saving

Next milestone (notepad editor):
- search (use kmp/boyermoore or something cool maybe)
- line jumps, page jumps
- cut/paste/multiline highlighting (requires better cursor manipulation)
- add a save menu
- delete key

TODO:
- Optional Word Wrapping
- Syntax highlighting (for just C++ and idk.. python)
- Formatting on save using like clang-formatter or pep 
- Piece table because thatâ€™s the only real reason
- Multicursor edits
- Some very basic form of word suggest? 
- A basic command palette (not that I know what to put in this yet. Maybe stuff like saving, new panes)
- Not sure if I can but multiple panes? (I feel like this leads into the library project)
- Smaller stuff would be like setting tab stops
